        <p>Happiest birthdayy my love,</p>

        <p>Its really fascinating how people find eachother,last december I wasn't even aware of your existence but this december Im beginning a new year with you,</p>

        <p> The thought makes me really happy that i got to spend your 18th birthday with you, not how i wanted to but still. I had plans which i unfortunately had to cancel cause of the sudden trip. But i am more than happy that you enjoyed it.</p>

        <p>Kabbo,im actually really grateful to have you. I have an extremely short temper and also am very sensitive so i get mad at trivial things though i promise to be better  in the new year.</p>

        <p>Its unexplainable how much I love you. Your joy brings me joy. I think of you day and night, not a single moment you're off my mind. You're the first thing i think of as my eyes see the light of day every morning and the last thing i think of as my eyes close to end the day.</p>

        <p>I have your goofy and moodyy pictures as well as your litol snaps of you just casually blinding my eye with your divine visuals and i love how you just simply fluff up your hair in every video, giving me a glimpse of your Adam's apple. Its all soooooo cutee.</p>

        <p>The first day i even saw you was 13th of May. I looked at your pfp in discord and went "He looks goofy" goofy in a cute way of course. I sent you a friend request for fun, I had a feeling you'd accept it and you did.</p>

        <p>Then i texted you a litol heyy and you replied back. The joy that single text gave me. Thats where our talking began, and honestly i cannot be more proud of myself that i texted you that day.</p>

        <p>You were so freaking adorable,I still remember the first night you sent me a "goodnight <33", and they say its not the little things that matter.</p>

        <p>Also the first day where you didn't reply to my text the entire day which made me sad and think maybe thats it, but you soon spammed my entire dms explaining, that was also insanely cute.</p>

        <p>Later on, you started creepin in my mind UNINVITED. yes i would look outside and it used to rain. You love the rain. I'd look at my painting.I showed you the painting and you liked it even though it was unfinished</p>

        <p>Whenever i started watching any show or a movie, you love them. When my dad randomly asks my mom for chaa, you love chaa. Your fave songs were on repeat in my playlist.</p>

        <p>I learned to stay quietly alone in my room and finidng it peaceful not lonely from you.</p>

        <p>You calm my mind, whenever anything that makes me upset i come to you. I want to talk to you if not about the thing that made me upset just a little chat which i know in your pov sounds weird but it really helps.</p>

        <p>You're my therapist. You told me you wanted to study psychology, not sure if you still want to but thats so cool.</p>

        <p>I felt safe around you,safe enough to tell you what makes me sad and what doesn't. Safe enough to say that you are the love of my life and that i want to continue starting every upcoming year being better together.</p>

        <p>Supporting you, caring for you, laughing with you, talking to you and much more.</p>

        <p>I may not say it as much i really mean it when i say that you are everything i ever wanted, you're perfect in my eyes idk bout others neither do i care.</p>

        <p>I love you as a whole. And no fights can change that.</p>

        <p>I love when you add the word "my" or "amar" infront of every silly nickname you give me, tho big dawg was not so cute.</p>

        <p>It was more funny which is also a reason why i love you. You're funny, you love joking. You can't live without your jokes or your fans will be devastated. tsk tsk tsk.</p>

        <p>Im not that sure about your past relationships but i want to make you feel like you have someone that you can truly rely and trust in, in the present and the future.</p>

        <p>And give you the all the love i have. I love talking to you, i love hearing your voice.</p>

        <p>You're a productive guy, who studies all the time. And is extremely cute when lovey dovey.</p>

        <p>I fall in love with you everyday. Everytime i see that cute face, hear that cute voice, see your cute actions.</p>

        <p>I love the curves on your eyes, especially how it naturally squints when you smile or laugh. I wanna kiss your dimples.</p>

        <p>Your smile is the most adorable thing in the world. Your giggles and laugh. Holy.</p>

        <p>My writing will not end if i continue writing everything i love about you.</p>

        <p>So i once again wish you the Happiest belated birthday. Though i hope you get showered with love and happiness this year and every other years. And hopefully i am there with you too. Either way i want you to be happy.</p>

        <p>I love you so much</p>

        <p>Love,your beloved batashi</p>
